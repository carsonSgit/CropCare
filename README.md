# üå± Functional Overview <a name="functional-overview"/>
CropCare seeks to deliver timely delivery of relevant data, and allow users to remotely control key systems for containerized gardens. Leveraling build in hardware solutions, we can monitor the relevant plant data and control related hardware to ensure secure and efficient plant growth. Our mobile application will facilitate this remote control and will provide users with a visual interface with which to view the relevant data.

# üìã Design Overview <a name="design-overview"/>
Designing the CropCare Guardian app involves creating an intuitive and efficient user interface that caters to the specific needs of both crop owners and crop technicians. The app's design must facilitate easy navigation between its various functionalities while providing a seamless user experience. Below is a detailed overview of the app's design, including descriptions of each screen, screen design elements, and the navigation flow.

### Login page <a name="login-page"/>
This screen will allow users to sign in to their accounts. Additionally, if the user does not have an account, they can click a link that navigates them to the register page. The page will contain a username field, a password field and a sign in button. There will be input validation to ensure proper input before credentials entered are sent off to authenticate the user.

### Register page <a name="register-page"/>
This page will be used for account creation. A user will have to fill out an email field, a username field, two password fields to confirm they match and a register button. There will also be a link back to the login page in case a user wound up in the register page by mistake. Form input validation is important on this page as well. Once the register button is clicked and the inputs are validated, the user will be moved to the account setup page. 

### Account setup page <a name="account-setup-page"/>
This page will be used to set a user account as a crop owner or crop technician. It is important to properly include the written difference between the two types of accounts so users can know which account type suits their requirements. It will be two big cards or buttons on the screen each containing the description of the account type. Once selected, a user can hit the ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù button to confirm the account type they need. 

## Overview page <a name="overview-page"/>
This page will list all the containers a user is associated with. It will list its status as healthy, needs attention or in critical condition. The page will also have the ability to remove containers using a swipe view and when tapped will open up the dashboard of a container. A button will be placed in the bottom corner of the screen to add a container.

### Dashboard <a name="dashboard"/>
The top of the dashboard will contain the status of your container. It will show the status as healthy, needs attention, or in critical condition. Below this status will be a section containing buttons that navigate to other pages. There will be a button that navigates to the monitoring page, a button that navigates to the control page, and a button that will bring you to the gps page (gps page is only displayed to crop owner).

### Monitor page <a name="monitor-page"/>
This page is a comprehensive dashboard that provides detailed information on the current state of the container's environment using our sensors. It will display all the important information about a container in a neat and pleasing way.

### Remote control page <a name="remote-control-page"/>
This page empowers users to remotely control various components within the container, allowing for immediate adjustments to the environment based on the data observed on the Monitor Page.

### GPS page <a name="gps-page"/>
This page is solely for crop owners. This page will have an interactive map of the world and will contain a marker of where their container is currently located.

### General Navigation and Design Notes: <a name="navigation-notes"/>
In order to keep the screen less cluttered, a flyout menu will be used. This menu will contain the dashboard page, the settings page and a logout button. The items in this flyout menu will use shell navigation and all other pages will be navigated using stack navigation, the exception being the login and register page being shell navigation. 

### Settings page <a name="settings-page"/>
This page will contain settings for the account of our users. These settings may include toggling app themes from a light mode to a dark mode using a switch button, as well as changing username, password, and email using text boxes.

# üì± App Prototype <a name="app-prototype"/>

# ü§© Potential Showstoppers <a name="potential-showstoppers"></a>
### Colour Theme <a name="colour-theme"></a>
To address the unique needs of every user and allow for a certain amount of customization, we wish to implement a colour switching option into our application. This will allow users to choose between light and dark themes enabling them to pick what fits best for them.

### Long Term Data Storage <a name="long-term-storage"></a>
By leveraging azure's cosmos database, we can store monitoring data long term. While the IOT hub only stores data for a short period of time at specific times, cosmos can store data forever, allowing us to display historical data to our users.

### Container Health Level <a name="container-health"></a>
We want to show the health of the farm of the user in the farm overview, allowing users to quickly assess which farms require attention at a glance. This feature will prevent users from having to click on each farm and go into them and see which need attention.
